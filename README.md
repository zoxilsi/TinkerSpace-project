### Project Description
KeyMystery is a web-based typing challenge game that scrambles your keyboard mappings to test memory, adaptability, and typing skills. Players must learn new key combinations on-the-fly while racing against time to type target words accurately.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People have become too comfortable with their QWERTY keyboards! Where's the challenge in typing when you know exactly where every key is? We need to make typing unnecessarily difficult and confusing again! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've created a game that randomly scrambles your keyboard mapping every round - pressing 'A' might type 'K', 'S' might type 'R', and so on. Players must memorize these new mappings while typing words under time pressure. It's like learning to type all over again, but with extra steps! üéÆ

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML5 (Structure and layout)
- CSS3 (Styling and animations with cosmic theme)
- Vanilla JavaScript (Game logic and interactions)
- Web APIs (Local Storage for persistence, Audio Context for sound)
- Responsive Design (Mobile-first approach)

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zoxilsi/TinkerSpace-project.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd TinkerSpace-project
```

# Run
```bash
# Start local server (Python 3)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js
npx http-server

# Open browser and go to
http://localhost:8000
```

## Game Mechanics
1. **Keyboard Scrambling**: A‚ÜíK, B‚ÜíR, C‚ÜíT, etc. (randomized each game)
2. **Word Challenges**: Type target words using the new mappings
3. **Time Pressure**: Complete as many words as possible within time limit
4. **Progressive Difficulty**: Words get longer and more complex
5. **Score Calculation**: Accuracy √ó Speed √ó Difficulty multipliers
6. **Achievement System**: Unlock milestones and track improvements
